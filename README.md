# ctc\_heat\_pump\_monitor

monitor and allow for heating wire when brine tubes are squeezed

## background

After the installation of a CTC 612, the company managed to freeze the whole partially, so that the brine flow was restricted.There is research that suggests that this is due to the bore hole freezing at two levels, and the liquid water in between
will eventually freeze and expand at the cost of squeezing the brine leads. This happens in bore holes that have a long distance down to rock.
One suggested solution is to put a heat wire into the part of the bore hole that is above solid rock. In my case, I have installed a 27 m head wire

## this code

the program `ctc_monitor.py` writes CTC 612 data to file `/var/log/ctc_log.txt`. The module `jan_heatpump_module.py`
contains the communication code, and a hard coded URL to the heat-pump

`ctc_monitor.py` also monitors the power to the wire, controlled by a "Shelly Plug S". The module `jan_shelly_module.py`
contains the communication code, and a hard coded URL for the power plug.
